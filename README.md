## Navigation
- Featured at the top of the page, navigation shows the Cork Swap project name and logo in the middle that links to the index page (About Us).
- The other navigation links are just below the Cork Swap logo and name, also in the center:
About Us, Why To Swap, Swap Snaps, Next Swap, which link to different sub-pages of the website.
- The navigation links are using similar font to the one used in the logo – bold, uppercase, with visible letter spacing, sans-serif (Montserrat), which make the font used over the navigation menu more consistent and very visible for the user. 
- Color used for the font easily contrasts with the background and pops above the hero image.
- Navigation clearly shows the name and logo of Cork Swap project, and thanks to selected colors and fonts – the information about different sections of the website is easy to find for the users.

# Website Surface
## Colors
The colors used throughout the site for its main styling are shown below. They are complimented by more colorful background image to give the website consistent, clean look. These colors and background were intentionally picked to keep the modern, simple design. They compliment each other well and keep great page contrast, which makes it more user-friendly and readable.

## Typography
I have chosen two fonts that have a continual use case throughout the design of the page.
- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montserrat) - main font that is used on the page for logo, navigation, headers. Very easy to read, modern looking font. For the website purpose used bolder with extra spacing between the letters.
- [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins) - easy-to-read sans-serif font that aesthetically compliments Montserrat in paragraph elements.

## Icons and images
- The main source for icons used throughout the website is [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
- The main source for images used in gallery section and the background image is [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).

# Testing

No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator. [Results](/assets/image-readme/html-validator.jpg)

## [Jigsaw CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)
No errors were returned when passing through the official Jigsaw validator. [Results](/assets/image-readme/jigsaw-css.jpg)

## [Lighthouse accessibility (Chrome DevTools)](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)
I confirmed that the colors and fonts chosen are easily readable and accessible by running it through Lighthouse in DevTools (both mobile and desktop versions).

- [Mobile results](/assets/image-readme/lighthouse-performance-mobile.jpg)

## Manual testing
- I manually tested that the website works in different browsers: Chrome, Safari, Firefox.
- I confirmed that this project is responsive, looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar and manually testing the page on different devices (laptops, tablet, iPhone and three different Android smartphones).
- I manually confirmed that the navigation, header, about us, why to swap, gallery and next swap pages, as well as contact information and newsletter sign up texts are all readable and easy to understand and use.
- I have confirmed that the newsletter form works: requires entry in the email field, will only accept email in the email field, and the submit button works.

# Bugs and fixes
## Solved bugs
- When the file got deployed I discovered that website title shows up on the top of every page in form of text element, that I wasn't able to remove or hide using CSS.
- I discovered that one of the closing tags in head element was not used properly and was missing one of the angle brackets that was influencing the title element to display on the page. Once closed properly – it moved title out of body into its proper function, and fixed the problem.
